#Portfolio 

The applications in this portfolio are SpringMVC versions of different projects I was assigned while I was an Apprentice at the Software Guild in Louisville, Kentucky. 

I chose these applications for this portfolio because they highlight the wide range of skills that I was trained on while in this program. For example: 

The Contact List application uses both JSP/Controller based an REST based approaches to accomplish its tasks. It communicates with a MySQL relational database and implements Spring Security mechanisms to create user, roles, and hashed passwords. 

The Superhero Sighting application uses a Spring MVC JSP/Controller approach to allow users CRUD capability. It also has a MySQL relational database and Spring Security. This application highlights my training in Object modeling for both SQL and Java. It also shows that I know the importance of good documentation and comment explanations within classes and methods.  

The OpenWeatherMap REST client shows my training in accessing opensource API's using jQuery to make Ajax calls, process the JSON responses, and use that data to dynamically manipulate HTML elements. This web service uses HTML, Bootstrap, Javascript, and jQuery. It shows that in addtion to server-side logic programming with Java, I also have training in client-side logic programming with Javascript.

Thank you for taking the time to look through my portfolio and please reach out if you are interested in teaming up. I am in the hunt for new Junior level projects to work on!
